                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>We are a grassroots team that was founded in <strong>January 2025</strong> by freshman, <strong>Habib Seid</strong> at Northfield High School in Northeast Denver. When he mentioned to his Biology teacher that he wanted to start a team, she reached out to FIRST Colorado and the Nightbots were formed.</p>
                        <p>With the generous support of the <strong>Argosy Foundation</strong> and a <strong>Google equity grant</strong>, we built our very first competitive robot, dubbed <strong>"Lil Sneaky"</strong>. We have students with a diverse array of identities and cultural backgrounds.</p>
                        <p>Despite getting a late start, we were able to pull together a team of over 20 students with skills in programming, electrical, media, fundraising, imagery, and construction. Defying all odds, we finished in <strong>14th place out of over 50 teams</strong> from all around the globe. To top it off, we won the coveted <strong>"Rookie of the Year"</strong> award at the Colorado Regionals!</p>

                        <h3>What We Do</h3>
                        <p>Each year, our team designs, builds, and programs a robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition, one of the world's leading STEM programs for high school students.</p>
                        <p>This experience gives our members the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world engineering challenges. Students gain valuable skills in design, coding, electrical systems, and fabrication, while also developing business, leadership, and communication abilities that prepare them for the future.</p>

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>Our mission is to increase access for groups that are under-represented in STEM fields, to use our knowledge to serve our community, and build a balanced, diverse, and talented team of young engineers. These activities help build skills and confidence far beyond the classroom to include technical knowledge, engineering design, teamwork, personal responsibility, leadership, and professionalism.</p>
